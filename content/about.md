# G'day, I'm Geoff.

I'm the person behind Moustache Metrics — a boutique AI practice based in Sydney that helps small and mid-sized businesses get AI actually working.

I don't do "AI strategy" slide decks. I'm not big on "proof of concepts" that live in a folder nobody opens. I mean the real thing: finding the process that's eating your team alive, building something that fixes it, and getting it live.

## The short version

I spent years at Atlassian and Salesforce, picked up an MBA along the way, and eventually realised the stuff I enjoyed most was the hands-on fixing — not the meetings about the meetings. These days I split my time between AI innovation work in the nuclear industry and helping businesses stop drowning in spreadsheets.

## What Moustache Metrics does

Most of the businesses I work with have the same story: they know AI could help, but they're either stuck figuring out where to start, or they've already spent money on tools nobody uses.

I start with a simple question: **"What's the spreadsheet everyone hates?"**

From there, we figure out what's worth automating, build a pilot to test if it works, and get it live. No jargon, no twelve-month roadmaps, no consultants who disappear after the strategy deck.

## Show, don't tell

I believe the best way to prove you can build things is to actually build things. That's why I'm publicly building and shipping [42 AI prototypes](/posts/hello-world/) over the course of 2026 — writing up what works, what doesn't, and what I learn along the way.

If you want to see how I think and work, that's probably the best place to start.
